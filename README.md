# Practice


1. Dbus-example

Fooling with DBus
I know dbus is important but I don't know much about it. I know that it's a popular inter-process communication system used in Gnome, with some connections to the kernel. It seems to me it would be good to learn about it.

So my little project idea is to set up some service, maybe a physics engine (probably ODE) as a dbus server, and clients can come to it and get physical simulations done by it. Curious question: is ODE multi- threaded in a way that two clients could simultaneously have it work on two unrelated physics simualtions?

I found these packages already installed:

dbus
dbus-x11
libdbus-1-3
libdbus-1-dev
python-dbus
Here are the Ubuntu packages I installed in order to be able to do this:

libdbus-glib-1-2
libdbus-glib-1-dev
libdbus-glib-1-doc
These doc packages are potentially useful:

libdbus-1-doc
libdbus-doc
dbus-1-doc
python-dbus-doc
I want to do some more with DBus, and package it as a debian package (both a bin package and a src package), and merge this with the make-debian-package directory.
